# First iteration of our Game Core for Hive
Todo:
- Unit tests.
- Implement GetAntMovingPositions
- Implement GetBeetleMovingPositions
- Implement GetGrasshopperMovingPositions
- Implement GetQueenBeeMovingPositions
- Implement GetSpiderMovingPositions
- Managing turns and keeping track of pieces.
- Validating movements and enforcing the rules of the game–e.g., Fix Regex tha validates inputs
- Refactor–e.g., remove unnecessary variables, data types, etc. Just improve the overall implementation not only in speed, but also in readability.
- Make sure that the player moves only THEIR pieces and not their opponent's.

If you have .NET on your machine, just run it with:
